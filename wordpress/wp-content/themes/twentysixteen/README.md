## Synopsis

This is the custom wordpress theme made for New Media Studies department at the Faculty of Arts, Charles University. The theme uses node.js and gulp for packaging LESS styles into a final css file and other features (See installation).

## Installation

When making changes to css, less, and javascript files, in order to "compile" them, use these commands in the exact order (node.js must be installed on your computer and PATH added):

    npm install (wait, it takes time to download all the libraries, later found in node_modules folder)
    gulp

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
